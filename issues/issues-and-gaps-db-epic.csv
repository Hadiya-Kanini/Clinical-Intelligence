Gap ID,Problem Category,What We Were Facing,Impact,Root Cause,What We Are Doing to Fix,Solution Approach,Expected Outcome,Status
GAP-001,Database Installation,No guidance on PostgreSQL installation and configuration,Developers blocked - don't know how to set up database environment,create-epics.md workflow doesn't detect database setup requirements from models.md,Create EP-DB-001 epic with PostgreSQL 15+ installation and pgvector extension setup,Add database requirement detection logic to workflow,Clear installation guide in epic deliverables,Documented
GAP-002,Migration Framework,No guidance on Entity Framework Core Migrations setup,No clear process for schema evolution and versioning,Workflow doesn't map migration-related requirements to any epic,Include EF Core Migrations initialization in EP-DB-001,Add migration framework detection in workflow,Migration strategy documented with versioning,Documented
GAP-003,Schema Creation,16 tables from ERD not covered in any epic,No actionable guidance for implementing the data model,EP-035 mentions schema but doesn't detail table creation from models.md ERD,Create baseline migration for all 16 tables in EP-DB-001,Extract table definitions from models.md ERD,All tables created with proper constraints,Documented
GAP-004,Database Indexing,DR-011 indexing requirements not mapped to any epic,Performance degradation without proper indexes,Workflow doesn't extract index requirements from design.md,Include all 7 indexes from DR-011 in EP-DB-001 deliverables,Map DR-011 to database setup epic,Indexes created for optimal performance,Documented
GAP-005,Static Admin Seed,No epic for static admin account database seed,No admin user to bootstrap the system,TR-014 mentioned in EP-009 but focuses on provisioning not DB seed,Include static admin seed data from environment variables in EP-DB-001,Add seed data requirements to epic,Admin account created during DB initialization,Documented
GAP-006,Connection Pooling,NFR-015 connection pooling not in any epic,Potential connection exhaustion and performance issues,Workflow doesn't map NFR-015 to database configuration,Configure connection pooling (min 10 max 100) in EP-DB-001,Map NFR-015 to database setup epic,Connection pooling configured correctly,Documented
GAP-007,Database Security,DR-012 connection string encryption scattered across epics,Security vulnerabilities in database layer,No dedicated database security configuration epic,Include connection string encryption and row-level security in EP-DB-001,Consolidate database security requirements,Database layer properly secured,Documented
GAP-008,Backup Procedures,No epic for database backup/restore procedures,Risk of data loss without backup strategy,Workflow doesn't detect backup requirements from design.md,Include backup/restore procedures with 30-day retention in EP-DB-001,Add backup strategy to database epic,Backup procedures documented and tested,Documented
GAP-009,Schema Flexibility,ERD treated as rigid specification,Developers afraid to modify schema during implementation,No guidance on schema evolution during development,Add schema flexibility note: ERD as baseline not constraint,Document that developers can add/modify via migrations,Flexible schema evolution with documentation,Documented
GAP-010,Epic Positioning,Database setup not prioritized correctly,Risk of implementing features before database exists,Workflow generates feature epics without database prerequisite check,Position EP-DB-001 after EP-TECH before EP-001,Add epic ordering logic to workflow,Database setup executed before features,Documented
