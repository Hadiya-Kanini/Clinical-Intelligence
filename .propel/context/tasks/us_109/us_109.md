## Story Title
   * Implement RabbitMQ monitoring and metrics

## Description
  * As an operator, I want RabbitMQ monitoring with queue depth, message rates, and consumer status, so that I can track processing health.

## Acceptance Criteria
  * Given RabbitMQ, When monitored, Then queue metrics, message rates, and consumer status are available (FR-106).
  * Given core metrics, When exposed, Then queue depth and latency are available to external monitoring tools (FR-107).
  * Given monitoring, When implemented, Then it supports alerting on thresholds.
  * Given the RabbitMQ management UI, When accessed, Then it provides detailed queue information.

## Edge Cases
   * What happens when queue depth grows unexpectedly?
   * How does the system handle monitoring when RabbitMQ is unavailable?
   * What happens when consumer count drops to zero?

## Traceability
