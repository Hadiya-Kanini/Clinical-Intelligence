## Story Title
   * Implement admin-only user creation endpoint

## Description
  * As an admin, I want to create new Standard User accounts through a secure admin endpoint with proper validation, so that I can onboard healthcare staff.

## Acceptance Criteria
  * Given I am authenticated as Admin, When I submit a user creation request, Then a new user account is created.
  * Given user creation request, When submitted, Then all required fields are validated (FR-009l).
  * Given a non-admin user, When they attempt to access the endpoint, Then they receive 403 Forbidden.
  * Given successful creation, When completed, Then USER_CREATED event is logged in audit trail.

## Edge Cases
   * What happens when creating a user with duplicate email (FR-009m)?
   * What happens when required fields are missing or invalid?
   * How does the system handle concurrent user creation requests?
