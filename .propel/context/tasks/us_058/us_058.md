## Story Title
   * Extract text with positional metadata from PDF/DOCX

## Description
  * As a platform engineer, I want text extracted from documents with page, section, and coordinate metadata, so that source references are accurate.

## Acceptance Criteria
  * Given a PDF file, When processed, Then text is extracted using PyPDFLoader with positional metadata (FR-030).
  * Given a DOCX file, When processed, Then text is extracted using Docx2txtLoader with positional metadata (FR-031).
  * Given extracted text, When stored, Then page number, section, and coordinates (when available) are preserved.
  * Given extraction, When completed, Then the text is ready for chunking and embedding.

## Edge Cases
   * What happens with scanned PDFs without text layer?
   * How does the system handle multi-column layouts?
   * What happens with documents containing images or tables?
