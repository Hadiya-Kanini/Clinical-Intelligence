## Story Title
   * Implement secure logout with token invalidation

## Description
  * As a user, I want secure logout that terminates my session and clears all authentication tokens server-side, so that my account remains protected after I leave the platform.

## Acceptance Criteria
  * Given I am authenticated, When I trigger logout, Then the Backend API invalidates my session server-side.
  * Given logout is successful, When the response is sent, Then the HttpOnly JWT cookie is cleared.
  * Given a token has been invalidated, When any request uses that token, Then the API returns 401 Unauthorized.
  * Given logout is successful, When the user is redirected, Then they see a logout confirmation message (FR-003a).

## Edge Cases
   * What happens when the logout API call fails due to network issues?
   * What happens if the user has multiple browser tabs open?
   * How does the system handle logout when the session has already expired?
