## Story Title
   * Show logout confirmation and redirect to Login

## Description
  * As a user, I want clear confirmation when I log out, so that I know my session ended and I can safely sign in again if needed.

## Acceptance Criteria
  * Given I am authenticated, When I trigger logout, Then the UI displays a logout confirmation message.
  * Given logout is successful, When the confirmation is shown, Then the user is redirected to the Login page (SCR-001) within 2 seconds.
  * Given logout is successful, When the user is redirected, Then the Login page is presented in its default state and no authenticated-only content is accessible.

## Edge Cases
   * What happens when logout fails due to network/API issues—does the UI clearly communicate status?
   * What happens if the user logs out in multiple tabs — does the UI in other tabs converge to the unauthenticated state?
   * What happens when the user logs out and immediately uses browser Back — does the app prevent access to authenticated content?
