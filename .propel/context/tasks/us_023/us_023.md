## Story Title
   * Configure strict CORS policy for frontend origin

## Description
  * As a security officer, I want CORS configured to allow only the approved frontend origin with credentials support, so that cross-origin attacks are prevented.

## Acceptance Criteria
  * Given a cross-origin request, When processed, Then only the configured frontend origin is allowed.
  * Given CORS configuration, When credentials are needed, Then Access-Control-Allow-Credentials is set to true.
  * Given preflight requests (OPTIONS), When received, Then appropriate CORS headers are returned.
  * Given an unauthorized origin, When a request is made, Then it is rejected with appropriate CORS error.

## Edge Cases
   * What happens when frontend origin changes during deployment?
   * How does the system handle multiple frontend origins (e.g., staging vs production)?
   * What happens when CORS headers are missing from the response?
