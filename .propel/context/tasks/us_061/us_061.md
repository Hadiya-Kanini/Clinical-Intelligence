## Story Title
   * Generate embeddings using Google Gemini API

## Description
  * As a platform engineer, I want 768-dimensional embeddings generated for each text chunk using Google Gemini Embedding API, so that semantic search is enabled.

## Acceptance Criteria
  * Given text chunks, When processed, Then 768-dimensional embeddings are generated using text-embedding-004 model (FR-033).
  * Given embedding generation, When API is called, Then rate limits are respected (15 RPM free tier).
  * Given API errors, When they occur, Then retry with exponential backoff is applied.
  * Given embeddings, When generated, Then they are associated with their source chunk metadata.

## Edge Cases
   * What happens when Gemini API is unavailable or rate-limited?
   * How does the system handle very long chunks that exceed API limits?
   * What happens when embedding generation fails for some chunks?
