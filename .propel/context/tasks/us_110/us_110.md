## Story Title
   * Implement structured logging for centralized aggregation

## Description
  * As an operator, I want structured logging across all services, so that logs can be aggregated and searched in centralized systems.

## Acceptance Criteria
  * Given any service (API, Worker), When logging, Then structured JSON format is used (FR-108).
  * Given log entries, When created, Then they include timestamp, level, service, correlation ID, and message.
  * Given structured logs, When aggregated, Then they are suitable for centralized log systems.
  * Given logging, When implemented, Then it follows consistent patterns across services (TR-012).

## Edge Cases
   * What happens when log volume is very high?
   * How does the system handle sensitive data in logs (PII/PHI)?
   * What happens when logging infrastructure is unavailable?
