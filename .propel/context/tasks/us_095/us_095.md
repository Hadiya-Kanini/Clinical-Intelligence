## Story Title
   * Implement RAG-powered query answering

## Description
  * As a clinician, I want my questions answered using document context via RAG, so that responses are accurate and grounded in source documents.

## Acceptance Criteria
  * Given a query, When processed, Then vector similarity search retrieves relevant chunks (FR-079).
  * Given retrieved chunks, When LLM generates answer, Then results are ranked by relevance (FR-080).
  * Given the answer, When displayed, Then it includes source citations as clickable links (UXR-038).
  * Given common queries, When asked, Then they are handled effectively (e.g., "Summarize medication history") (FR-081).

## Edge Cases
   * What happens when no relevant chunks are found?
   * How does the system handle ambiguous queries?
   * What happens when the LLM API is unavailable?
