## Story ID
   * ID Format: US_036

## Story Title
   * Enforce no public registration policy

## Description
  * As a security officer, I want public user registration disabled, so that only admin-created accounts can access the system.

## Acceptance Criteria
  * Given the public pages (login, forgot password), When displayed, Then no "Sign Up" or "Register" links are visible (UXR-005).
  * Given the API, When no public registration endpoint exists, Then attempts to register return 404.
  * Given user creation, When attempted, Then it is only possible through admin-authenticated endpoints.
  * Given the login page, When displayed, Then it only shows login and forgot password options.

## Edge Cases
   * What happens when someone tries to POST to a hypothetical registration endpoint?
   * How does the system handle requests that attempt to create users without admin auth?
   * What happens when an attacker tries to enumerate registration endpoints?
