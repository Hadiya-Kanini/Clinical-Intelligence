## Story Title
   * Display code validation status

## Description
  * As a medical coder, I want to see code validation status (valid/invalid/deprecated), so that I know if codes are current and usable.

## Acceptance Criteria
  * Given a code, When displayed, Then its validation status is shown with color-coded badge (UXR-035).
  * Given a deprecated code, When displayed, Then a warning is shown with tooltip details.
  * Given an invalid code, When detected, Then it is highlighted for correction.
  * Given validation status, When checked, Then it uses the current catalog version.

## Edge Cases
   * What happens when validation data is unavailable?
   * How does the system handle codes that become deprecated after selection?
   * What happens when the catalog is being refreshed during validation?
