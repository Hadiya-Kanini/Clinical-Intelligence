## Story Title
   * Provide manual code entry when no match found

## Description
  * As a medical coder, I want to manually add codes when no automatic match is found, so that all relevant billing codes are captured.

## Acceptance Criteria
  * Given no code match is found, When displayed, Then "No ICD/CPT code found" message with manual entry option appears (FR-069).
  * Given manual entry, When triggered, Then a search/filter interface is available (UXR-033).
  * Given manual code addition, When saved, Then it is tracked with "manually_added" status (FR-070).
  * Given code search, When used, Then it supports autocomplete and filtering by code type.

## Edge Cases
   * What happens when manually entered code is invalid or deprecated?
   * How does the system handle duplicate manual entries?
   * What happens when the user searches for a code that doesn't exist?
