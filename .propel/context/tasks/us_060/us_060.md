## Story Title
   * Split text into semantic chunks with overlap

## Description
  * As a platform engineer, I want text split into 500-1000 token chunks with 100-token overlap using RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter, so that retrieval is effective.

## Acceptance Criteria
  * Given merged text, When chunked, Then chunks are 500-1000 tokens in size (TR-005).
  * Given chunking, When performed, Then 100-token overlap is maintained between adjacent chunks.
  * Given chunking, When implemented, Then RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter from LangChain is used (FR-032a).
  * Given chunks, When created, Then they preserve document source metadata for each chunk.

## Edge Cases
   * What happens with very short documents (less than 500 tokens)?
   * How does the system handle documents with unusual formatting?
   * What happens when chunk boundaries fall in the middle of sentences?
