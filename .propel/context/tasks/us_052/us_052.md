   * Display document list with status and metadata

## Description
  * As a standard user, I want a document list showing status, upload date, and processing metadata, so that I can track my uploads.

## Acceptance Criteria
  * Given I navigate to Document List (SCR-006), When displayed, Then I see all my documents.
  * Given the document list, When displayed, Then each document shows status, upload date, and processing metadata (FR-022).
  * Given many documents, When displayed, Then pagination is implemented with configurable page size (TR-017).
