## Story Title
   * Implement export gating based on conflict resolution

## Description
  * As a clinician, I want export blocked until all conflicts are resolved and code reviews are complete, so that exported data is accurate and complete.

## Acceptance Criteria
  * Given unresolved conflicts exist, When export is attempted, Then it is blocked (FR-086).
  * Given pending code reviews, When export is attempted, Then it is blocked until codes are reviewed.
  * Given the "Finalize & Export" button, When clicked, Then system validates completeness (FR-082).
  * Given validation failure, When detected, Then specific blocking issues are highlighted.

## Edge Cases
   * What happens when status changes during export preparation?
   * How does the system handle partial exports?
   * What happens when new conflicts appear after validation passes?
