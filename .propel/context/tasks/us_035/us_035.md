## Story Title
   * Restrict admin-only features from Standard Users

## Description
  * As a security officer, I want Standard Users blocked from accessing admin features at both API and UI levels, so that privilege separation is enforced.

## Acceptance Criteria
  * Given a Standard User, When they attempt to access admin API endpoints, Then they receive 403 Forbidden.
  * Given a Standard User, When they navigate to admin UI routes, Then they are redirected to their dashboard.
  * Given the navigation menu, When displayed to Standard Users, Then admin menu items are not visible.
  * Given authorization checks, When performed, Then they occur on every request (not just initial load).

## Edge Cases
   * What happens when a Standard User tries to directly access admin UI routes via URL?
   * How does the system handle cached admin pages after role downgrade?
   * What happens when authorization middleware fails?
