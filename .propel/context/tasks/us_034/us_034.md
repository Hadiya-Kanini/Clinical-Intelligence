## Story Title
   * Initialize static admin account via database seed

## Description
  * As a platform engineer, I want a static admin account created during database setup with credentials from environment variables, so that initial system access is available.

## Acceptance Criteria
  * Given database initialization, When the seed/migration runs, Then a static admin account is created.
  * Given the static admin account, When created, Then credentials are read from secure environment variables (FR-010b).
  * Given the static admin account, When created, Then the password is hashed using bcrypt.
  * Given the static admin account, When it exists, Then it cannot be deleted or deactivated (FR-010c).

## Edge Cases
   * What happens when environment variables for admin credentials are missing?
   * What happens when the seed runs multiple times (idempotency)?
   * How does the system handle weak admin passwords in environment variables?
