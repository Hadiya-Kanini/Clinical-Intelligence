## Story Title
   * Display typing indicator during AI response generation

## Description
  * As a clinician, I want to see a typing indicator while the AI generates a response, so that I know the system is working.

## Acceptance Criteria
  * Given a query is submitted, When AI is processing, Then a typing indicator (animated dots) is displayed (UXR-037).
  * Given the indicator, When displayed, Then it shows "AI is thinking..." or similar message.
  * Given response generation, When complete, Then the indicator is replaced with the response.
  * Given the UI, When waiting, Then the input is disabled to prevent duplicate submissions.

## Edge Cases
   * What happens when response takes very long (>30 seconds)?
   * How does the system handle timeout scenarios?
   * What happens when the user navigates away during processing?
