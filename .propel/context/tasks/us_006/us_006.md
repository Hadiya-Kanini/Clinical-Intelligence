## Story Title
   * Create professional login page UI

## Description
  * As a user, I want a professional healthcare-appropriate Login page, so that I can trust the platform and sign in confidently.

## Acceptance Criteria
  * Given I am unauthenticated, When I navigate to the Login page (SCR-001), Then the page renders a clean, professional healthcare-appropriate design and branding (medical color palette, professional typography, clear hierarchy).
  * Given I am unauthenticated, When I view the Login page, Then the page includes:
    - Email input field
    - Password input field
    - Login submit button
  * Given the Login page is implemented, When UI styles are applied, Then the page uses design system tokens (no hard-coded colors) and remains readable and consistent.

## Edge Cases
   * What happens when the viewport is narrow or zoomed and the login layout overflows?
   * What happens when the login page is rendered with high-contrast OS/browser settings and critical elements become indistinguishable?
   * How does the page behave if the logo/branding assets are unavailable (fallback text/placeholder)?
