## Story Title
   * Track document processing status

## Description
  * As a standard user, I want to see document processing status, so that I know when my documents are ready for review.

## Acceptance Criteria
  * Given a document is uploaded, When processing begins, Then status transitions: Pending → Processing → Completed/Failed (FR-020).
  * Given status changes, When they occur, Then the database is updated with current status.
  * Given the document list, When displayed, Then each document shows its current status.
  * Given a failed document, When status is Failed, Then the status includes Validation_Failed for validation errors (TR-004).

## Edge Cases
   * What happens when processing gets stuck in "Processing" state?
   * How does the system handle status updates during network issues?
   * What happens when the status update fails after processing completes?
