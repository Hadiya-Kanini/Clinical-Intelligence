## Story Title
   * Display clear file validation errors

## Description
  * As a standard user, I want clear error messages when files fail validation, so that I can understand the issue and fix it.

## Acceptance Criteria

  * Given validation errors, When displayed, Then each file shows its own specific error inline.
  * Given a validation error, When displayed, Then it includes guidance on how to fix the issue.
  * Given multiple files, When some fail validation, Then valid files can still be uploaded.

## Edge Cases
   * What happens when multiple files fail with different errors?
   * How does the UI handle very long error messages?
   * What happens when all files in a batch fail validation?
