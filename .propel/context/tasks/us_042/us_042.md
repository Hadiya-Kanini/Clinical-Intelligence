## Story Title
   * Implement drag-and-drop document upload UI

## Description
  * As a standard user, I want to drag and drop files to upload, so that document submission is quick and intuitive.

## Acceptance Criteria
  * Given I am on the Document Upload page (SCR-005), When I drag files onto the drop zone, Then they are queued for upload.
  * Given the drop zone, When files are dragged over it, Then it highlights to indicate it's a valid drop target (UXR-019).
  * Given file selection, When I use the file picker, Then I can select multiple files at once (UXR-022).
  * Given files are selected, When displayed, Then the file count and names are shown before upload.
