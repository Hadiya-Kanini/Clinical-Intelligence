## Story Title
   * Display generic response for password reset requests

## Description
  * As a security officer, I want generic "check your email" responses for all password reset requests, so that attackers cannot enumerate valid accounts.

## Acceptance Criteria
  * Given any email is submitted for reset, When processed, Then the same generic "check your email" message is displayed.
  * Given an email that exists in the system, When reset is requested, Then the response is identical to non-existent emails.
  * Given the generic response, When displayed, Then it does not reveal whether the email exists.
  * Given response timing, When implemented, Then consistent response times prevent timing-based enumeration.

## Edge Cases
   * What happens when timing differences reveal email existence?
   * How does the system handle the case where email sending fails but response is still generic?
   * What happens when a user repeatedly requests resets for the same email?
