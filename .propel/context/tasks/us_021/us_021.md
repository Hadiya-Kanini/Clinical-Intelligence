## Story Title
   * Implement secure password hashing with bcrypt

## Description
  * As a security officer, I want passwords hashed using bcrypt with minimum 12 rounds, so that stored credentials are protected against rainbow table and brute-force attacks.

## Acceptance Criteria
  * Given a password is created or changed, When it is stored, Then bcrypt hashing with minimum 12 rounds is applied.
  * Given a user authenticates, When password is verified, Then bcrypt comparison is used (timing-safe).
  * Given password hashing, When implemented, Then plain-text passwords are never logged or stored.
  * Given bcrypt configuration, When rounds are set, Then the value is configurable for future security updates.

## Edge Cases
   * What happens when bcrypt processing time impacts login performance under high load?
   * How does the system handle hash algorithm upgrades in the future?
   * What happens if bcrypt library is unavailable or fails?
