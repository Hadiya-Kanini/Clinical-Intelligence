## Story Title
   * Enforce batch upload limit of 10 files

## Description
  * As a platform engineer, I want batch uploads limited to 10 files per batch, so that system resources are managed effectively.

## Acceptance Criteria
  * Given a batch upload, When more than 10 files are selected, Then only the first 10 are accepted.
  * Given batch limit is exceeded, When detected, Then a warning is displayed about the remaining files.
  * Given the upload UI, When files are selected, Then the count is displayed and limit is communicated.
  * Given the API, When more than 10 files are submitted, Then excess files are rejected with clear error.

## Edge Cases

   * How does the UI handle the selection of exactly 10 files?
   * What happens when some of the 10 files fail validation?
