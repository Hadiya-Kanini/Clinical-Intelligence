## Story Title
   * Support periodic catalog refresh

## Description
  * As an operator, I want to refresh ICD-10 and CPT catalogs periodically, so that codes stay current with medical coding standards.

## Acceptance Criteria
  * Given catalog updates are available, When refresh is triggered, Then new codes are imported (FR-071).
  * Given refresh process, When running, Then existing codes are updated and new codes are added.
  * Given refresh, When completed, Then deprecated codes are marked but not deleted.
  * Given refresh mechanism, When designed, Then it supports both manual and scheduled triggers.

## Edge Cases
   * What happens when refresh fails mid-import?
   * How does the system handle codes that are removed in new versions?
   * What happens when refresh is triggered during active code lookups?
