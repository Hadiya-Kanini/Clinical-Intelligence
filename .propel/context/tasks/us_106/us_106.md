## Story Title
   * Implement security audit log viewer for admins

## Description
  * As an admin, I want a paginated, filterable audit log viewer, so that I can review security events and investigate incidents.

## Acceptance Criteria
  * Given the admin dashboard, When I access Security Logs (SCR-015), Then a searchable audit trail is displayed (FR-090).
  * Given the log viewer, When displayed, Then it supports filtering by user, action type, date range, IP (UXR-045).
