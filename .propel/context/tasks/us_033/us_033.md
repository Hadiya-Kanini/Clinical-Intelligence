## Story Title
   * Define Admin and Standard User roles

## Description
  * As a security officer, I want two distinct roles (Admin and Standard User) with different permissions, so that access is appropriately restricted based on job function.

## Acceptance Criteria
  * Given the system, When roles are defined, Then Admin and Standard User roles exist with distinct permission sets.
  * Given the Admin role, When assigned, Then the user can access User Management and System Health functions (FR-011).
  * Given the Standard User role, When assigned, Then the user can access Patient Dashboard, Document Upload, and Profile functions (FR-012).
  * Given role definitions, When implemented, Then they are enforced at both API and UI levels.

## Edge Cases
   * What happens when a user's role is changed mid-session?
   * How does the system handle requests to endpoints outside the user's role permissions?
   * What happens when role definitions are updated in the system?
