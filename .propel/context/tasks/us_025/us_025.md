## Story Title
   * Generate secure password reset tokens

## Description
  * As a security officer, I want password reset tokens to be cryptographically secure with 1-hour expiration, so that reset links cannot be guessed or used indefinitely.

## Acceptance Criteria
  * Given a password reset request, When a token is generated, Then it uses cryptographically secure random generation.
  * Given a reset token, When created, Then it has a 1-hour expiration time.
  * Given a reset token, When stored, Then only the hash is persisted (not the plain token).
  * Given multiple reset requests, When a new token is generated, Then previous tokens for that user are invalidated.

## Edge Cases
   * What happens when a user requests multiple reset tokens in quick succession?
   * How does the system handle clock skew between servers?
   * What happens when the token storage is unavailable?
