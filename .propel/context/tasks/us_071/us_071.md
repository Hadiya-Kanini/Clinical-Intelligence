## Story Title
   * Show extraction rationale on hover

## Description
  * As a clinician, I want to see extraction rationale on hover, so that I understand why the AI extracted specific data.

## Acceptance Criteria
  * Given an entity, When I hover over it, Then extraction rationale is displayed in a tooltip (FR-055).
  * Given the rationale, When displayed, Then it explains why this value was extracted from the source.
  * Given the tooltip, When shown, Then it includes the cited source text.
  * Given hover interaction, When triggered, Then response is within 200ms (UXR-017).

## Edge Cases
   * What happens when rationale is not available from the LLM?
