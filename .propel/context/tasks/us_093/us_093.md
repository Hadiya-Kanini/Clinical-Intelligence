## Story Title
   * Apply consistent design system across all screens

## Description
  * As a user, I want consistent visual design across all screens using the defined design system, so that the app feels cohesive and professional.

## Acceptance Criteria
  * Given any screen, When displayed, Then it uses design system tokens (colors, typography, spacing) (UXR-016).
  * Given desktop viewports (1280px+), When displayed, Then layouts adapt seamlessly (UXR-015).
  * Given error messages, When displayed, Then they are clear, actionable, and consistent (UXR-018).
  * Given components, When used, Then they follow the component library specifications.

## Edge Cases
   * What happens when new components are needed that aren't in the design system?
   * How does the system handle browser-specific rendering differences?
   * What happens when design tokens are updated?
