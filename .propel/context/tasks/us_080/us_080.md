## Story Title
   * Prevent finalization until all conflicts resolved

## Description
  * As a clinician, I want export blocked until all conflicts are resolved, so that incomplete or inconsistent data isn't exported.

## Acceptance Criteria
  * Given unresolved conflicts exist, When export is attempted, Then it is blocked (UXR-031).
  * Given the export button, When conflicts remain, Then it is disabled with tooltip explaining pending conflicts.
  * Given conflict count, When displayed, Then it shows how many conflicts remain.
  * Given all conflicts resolved, When checked, Then the export button becomes enabled.

## Edge Cases
   * What happens when new conflicts appear after partial resolution?
   * How does the system handle the case where conflicts are resolved but not saved?
   * What happens when the conflict count changes during the session?
