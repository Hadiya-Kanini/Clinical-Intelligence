## Story Title
   * Implement retry with exponential backoff

## Description
  * As a platform engineer, I want failed processing jobs retried with exponential backoff up to 3 times, so that transient failures are handled gracefully.

## Acceptance Criteria
  * Given a processing job fails, When retried, Then exponential backoff is applied (e.g., 1s, 2s, 4s) (NFR-008).
  * Given retry attempts, When tracked, Then the retry count is recorded in job metadata (FR-027).
  * Given maximum retries (3), When exhausted, Then the job is moved to dead letter queue.
  * Given retry logic, When implemented, Then it distinguishes between retryable and non-retryable errors.

## Edge Cases
   * What happens when all retries are exhausted?
   * How does the system handle errors that occur during retry delay?
   * What happens when the same job is picked up by multiple workers?

## Traceability
