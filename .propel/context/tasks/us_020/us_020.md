## Story Title
   * Implement input sanitization and injection prevention

## Description
  * As a security officer, I want all user inputs sanitized to prevent SQL injection, XSS, and other injection attacks, so that the system is protected from malicious input.

## Acceptance Criteria
  * Given any user input, When processed by the backend, Then it is sanitized against SQL injection attacks.
  * Given any user input, When rendered in the UI, Then it is sanitized against XSS attacks.
  * Given suspicious input patterns, When detected, Then the request is rejected with appropriate error (FR-009g).
  * Given input sanitization, When implemented, Then parameterized queries are used for all database operations.

## Edge Cases
   * What happens with legitimate input that looks like code (e.g., code snippets in clinical notes)?
   * How does the system handle very long input strings?
   * What happens when input contains valid HTML entities?
