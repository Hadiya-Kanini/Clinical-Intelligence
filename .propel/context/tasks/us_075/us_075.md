## Story Title
   * Detect conflicts during entity extraction

## Description
  * As a platform engineer, I want conflicts detected during entity extraction when different values exist for the same field across documents.

## Acceptance Criteria
  * Given multiple documents for a patient, When extraction runs, Then conflicts are detected for the same field (FR-057).
  * Given conflict detection, When triggered, Then it covers DOB, allergies, medication dosages, and other critical data (FR-058).
  * Given the LLM prompt, When designed, Then conflict identification is included in structured output (TR-006).
  * Given detected conflicts, When found, Then they are output in structured format.

## Edge Cases
   * What happens when conflict detection fails or is incomplete?
   * How does the system handle minor variations (e.g., date formats)?
   * What happens when the same conflict is detected multiple times?
