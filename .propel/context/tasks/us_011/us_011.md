## Story Title
   * Implement JWT authentication with HttpOnly cookies

## Description
  * As a user, I want secure JWT-based authentication with HttpOnly cookie storage, so that my session is protected from XSS attacks and I can securely access the platform.

## Acceptance Criteria
  * Given a user submits valid email and password, When the Backend API validates credentials, Then a JWT access token with 15-minute expiration is generated.
  * Given a JWT is generated, When the response is sent, Then the token is stored in an HttpOnly, Secure cookie (not accessible via JavaScript).
  * Given a user has a valid JWT cookie, When they make authenticated requests, Then the Backend API validates the token and authorizes the request.
  * Given a JWT is invalid or expired, When the user makes a request, Then the API returns 401 Unauthorized.

## Edge Cases
   * What happens when the JWT expires mid-session while the user is actively working?
   * What happens if the cookie is tampered with or malformed?
   * How does the system handle requests without a JWT cookie?
