## Story Title
   * Validate extracted entities against Pydantic schemas

## Description
  * As a platform engineer, I want extracted entities validated against versioned Pydantic schemas, so that data quality and consistency are ensured.

## Acceptance Criteria
  * Given extracted entities, When validated, Then they must conform to versioned Pydantic schemas (FR-038).
  * Given validation failure, When detected, Then the job is marked Failed with validation errors persisted (TR-007).
  * Given schema versions, When updated, Then backward compatibility is maintained.
  * Given valid entities, When stored, Then they are ready for UI rendering and export.

## Edge Cases
   * What happens when validation fails for some but not all entities?
   * How does the system handle schema version mismatches?
   * What happens when required fields are missing from LLM output?
