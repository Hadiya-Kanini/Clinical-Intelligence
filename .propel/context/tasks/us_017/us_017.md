## Story Title
   * Display rate limit and lockout messages in UI

## Description
  * As a user, I want clear messages when I'm rate-limited or locked out, so that I understand what happened and when I can retry.

## Acceptance Criteria
  * Given the API returns HTTP 429, When the UI receives the response, Then it displays a message with the retry timeframe (UXR-010).
  * Given an account is locked, When the login attempt fails with lockout error, Then the UI displays the remaining lockout time and reason (UXR-009).
  * Given a lockout message is displayed, When the lockout period expires, Then the UI allows retry without requiring page refresh.
  * Given rate limit or lockout occurs, When the message is displayed, Then it includes contact support option for assistance.

## Edge Cases
   * What happens when the retry time is very long (e.g., 30 minutes)?
   * How does the UI handle countdown timer accuracy across browser tabs?
   * What happens when the user refreshes the page during lockout?
