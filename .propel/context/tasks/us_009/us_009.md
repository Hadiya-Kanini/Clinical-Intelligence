## Story Title
   * Provide Forgot Password navigation from Login

## Description
  * As a user, I want a prominent "Forgot Password" link on the Login page, so that I can start account recovery if I can’t sign in.

## Acceptance Criteria
  * Given I am on the Login page (SCR-001), When I view the page, Then a "Forgot Password" link is prominently displayed without requiring scrolling.
  * Given I am on the Login page, When I activate the "Forgot Password" link, Then I am navigated to the Forgot Password page (SCR-002).
  * Given I am using keyboard navigation, When I tab through interactive elements, Then the "Forgot Password" link is reachable and actionable via keyboard.

## Edge Cases
   * What happens when the link is not reachable via keyboard navigation?
   * What happens when a user repeatedly clicks the link — does navigation remain stable (no duplicate routing states)?
   * What happens when the user returns to Login from Forgot Password — is the previous email value preserved where appropriate?
