## Story Title
   * Implement session tracking and inactivity timeout

## Description
  * As a security officer, I want automatic session timeout after 15 minutes of inactivity, so that unattended sessions don't pose a security risk to PHI.

## Acceptance Criteria
  * Given a user is authenticated, When 15 minutes pass without any user activity, Then the session is automatically terminated.
  * Given a session is terminated due to inactivity, When the user attempts any action, Then they are redirected to the login page with a session expired message.
  * Given a user performs any action (API call, navigation), When the action is processed, Then the session's last activity timestamp is updated.
  * Given a session exists, When the Backend API processes requests, Then it tracks session state server-side for revocation capability.

## Edge Cases
   * What happens when the user has unsaved work at the time of timeout?
   * What happens if the client clock is significantly different from the server clock?
   * How does the system handle concurrent sessions from the same user (FR-008)?
