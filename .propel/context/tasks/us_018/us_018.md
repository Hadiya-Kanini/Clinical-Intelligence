## Story Title
   * Implement RFC-compliant email validation

## Description
  * As a developer, I want email validation using RFC 5322 compliant patterns on both frontend and backend, so that only valid email formats are accepted.

## Acceptance Criteria
  * Given a user enters an email address, When validation runs, Then RFC 5322 compliant regex patterns are used.
  * Given an invalid email format, When validation fails, Then a clear error message indicates the specific issue.
  * Given email validation, When implemented, Then it validates on both frontend (immediate feedback) and backend (security).
  * Given edge-case valid emails (e.g., user+tag@domain.com), When entered, Then they are accepted as valid.

## Edge Cases
   * What happens with edge-case valid emails like user+tag@domain.com?
   * How does the system handle internationalized domain names (IDN)?
   * What happens with very long email addresses at the RFC limit?
