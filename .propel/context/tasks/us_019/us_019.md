## Story Title
   * Enforce password complexity requirements

## Description
  * As a security officer, I want password complexity enforced with minimum 8 characters, mixed case letters, numbers, and special characters, so that weak passwords are prevented.

## Acceptance Criteria
  * Given a user sets or changes a password, When complexity is validated, Then it must have minimum 8 characters.
  * Given password complexity validation, When checked, Then it must contain at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number, and one special character.
  * Given password complexity requirements, When the user types, Then the UI shows requirements with real-time checkmarks as each is met (UXR-012).
  * Given an invalid password, When validation fails, Then specific missing requirements are highlighted.

## Edge Cases
   * What happens when a user's existing password doesn't meet new requirements after a policy update?
   * How does the system handle passwords with unicode special characters?
   * What is the maximum password length allowed?
