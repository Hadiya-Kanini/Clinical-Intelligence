## Story Title
   * Implement reset password page with token validation

## Description
  * As a user, I want a reset password page that validates my token and lets me set a new password with strength feedback, so that I can securely recover my account.

## Acceptance Criteria
  * Given I click the reset link in email, When the page loads, Then the token is validated before displaying the form (FR-116a).
  * Given a valid token, When the form is displayed, Then it includes new password and confirm password fields (FR-116b).
  * Given password input, When typing, Then a password strength indicator is displayed (FR-116c, UXR-006).
  * Given an expired or invalid token, When detected, Then an error message is shown with option to request new reset.

## Edge Cases
   * What happens when the token is expired (>1 hour old)?
   * What happens when the token has already been used?
   * How does the system handle malformed tokens in the URL?
