## Story Title
   * Queue documents in RabbitMQ for processing

## Description
  * As a platform engineer, I want documents queued in RabbitMQ for background processing, so that uploads don't block the user interface.

## Acceptance Criteria
  * Given a document is uploaded and validated, When stored, Then a processing job is enqueued in RabbitMQ (FR-023).
  * Given the job message, When created, Then it includes document_id, patient_id, and required metadata.
  * Given asynchronous processing, When jobs are queued, Then the user interface is not blocked (FR-024).
  * Given the queue, When jobs are enqueued, Then they are persisted for durability.

## Edge Cases
   * What happens when RabbitMQ is unavailable?
   * How does the system handle queue backpressure?
   * What happens when the job message is malformed?

## Traceability
