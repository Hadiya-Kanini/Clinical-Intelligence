## Story Title
   * Implement API versioning convention

## Description
  * As a frontend and backend developer, I want all API endpoints to follow a stable versioned URL convention, so that we can evolve the API without breaking clients.

## Acceptance Criteria
  * Given the Backend API exposes application endpoints, When an endpoint is implemented, Then its route is prefixed with `/api/v1/`.
  * Given a client sends a request to an unversioned route (e.g., `/auth/login`), When the API receives the request, Then it responds with a not found/unsupported route result and does not serve application functionality from unversioned paths.
  * Given a client sends a request to an unsupported version (e.g., `/api/v2/...`), When the API receives the request, Then it responds with a clear unsupported version error using the standardized error format.
  * Given the API publishes documentation, When Swagger UI is generated, Then the documented endpoints reflect the `/api/v1/` prefix.

## Edge Cases
   * What happens when a reverse proxy strips the `/api` prefix unexpectedly?
   * How does the API behave when both `/api/v1/` and unversioned routes are accidentally mapped (routing ambiguity)?
