# User Story:
  * ID: [US_004]
  * Title: [Establish maintainability guardrails]
## Description:
   * [As a technical lead, I want maintainability guardrails (clear separation of concerns, contract-first development, and migration/versioning practices), so that the platform remains easy to change as features scale.]
## Acceptance Criteria:
   * [Given a developer adds or changes a feature, When they follow the project guardrails, Then the change stays within the correct service boundary, updates the relevant contract, and is supported by a migration/versioning approach.]
## Edge Cases:
   * [What happens when a change spans multiple services or introduces a breaking contract change?]

## Story Title
   * Establish maintainability guardrails

## Description
  * As a technical lead, I want maintainability guardrails (clear separation of concerns, contract-first development, and migration/versioning practices), so that the platform remains easy to change as features scale.

## Acceptance Criteria
  * Given the solution contains multiple services, When new functionality is implemented, Then it is placed in the correct service (Web UI vs Backend API vs AI Worker) and does not bypass the published contracts.
  * Given the Backend API evolves over time, When API endpoints are added or changed, Then the Swagger/OpenAPI contract is updated and the versioning strategy is followed (including documenting any breaking changes).
  * Given the database schema evolves over time, When a schema change is required, Then it is implemented through a migration mechanism (schema versioning) rather than ad-hoc manual edits.
  * Given the AI Worker entity schemas evolve, When entity output or validation schemas change, Then the schema is versioned and the system can distinguish versions (to support safe processing and retries).

## Edge Cases
   * What happens when a breaking change is introduced accidentally—how is it detected and rolled back?
   * How does the team handle dual-running contract versions during a transition period?
   * What happens when the worker retries a job created under a previous schema version?
