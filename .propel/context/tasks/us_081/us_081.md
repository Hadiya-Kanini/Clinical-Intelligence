## Story Title
   * Store ICD-10 and CPT code catalogs

## Description
  * As a platform engineer, I want ICD-10 and CPT catalogs stored in the database with full-text search indexing, so that code mapping is accurate and fast.

## Acceptance Criteria
  * Given the database, When catalogs are loaded, Then ICD-10 codes are stored with descriptions (FR-063).
  * Given the database, When catalogs are loaded, Then CPT codes are stored with descriptions (FR-064).
  * Given code storage, When indexed, Then full-text search is enabled on descriptions (DR-007).
  * Given the catalogs, When queried, Then codes are searchable by code or description.

## Edge Cases
   * What happens when catalog data is corrupted during import?
   * How does the system handle duplicate codes?
   * What happens when the catalog is very large (100k+ codes)?
