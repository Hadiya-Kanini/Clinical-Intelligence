## Story Title
   * Link multiple documents to same patient

## Description
  * As a clinician, I want documents linked to the same patient via MRN or name+DOB matching, so that data is aggregated correctly across documents.

## Acceptance Criteria
  * Given multiple documents, When patient matching runs, Then they are linked via MRN match (primary) (FR-050).
  * Given no MRN match, When patient matching runs, Then name+DOB matching is used as fallback.
  * Given patient linkage, When established, Then all documents contribute to the unified patient view.
  * Given matching rules, When applied, Then they handle variations in name formatting.

## Edge Cases
   * What happens when patient identifiers conflict across documents?
   * How does the system handle typos in patient names?
   * What happens when DOB formats differ between documents?
