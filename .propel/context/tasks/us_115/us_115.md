## Story Title
   * Define FHIR-aligned patient-centric data model

## Description
  * As a platform engineer, I want a FHIR-aligned patient-centric schema, so that future EHR integration is possible without major refactoring.

## Acceptance Criteria
  * Given the data model, When designed, Then it is compatible with future FHIR mapping (DR-001).
  * Given patient records, When stored, Then they follow patient-centric organization (demographics, encounters, observations, medications, diagnoses, procedures).
  * Given the schema, When designed, Then it supports Phase 1 standalone usage while being integration-ready.
  * Given entity relationships, When defined, Then they align with FHIR resource relationships.

## Edge Cases
   * What happens when FHIR standards change?
   * How does the system handle data that doesn't map cleanly to FHIR?
   * What happens when multiple FHIR versions need to be supported?
