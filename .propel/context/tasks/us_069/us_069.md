## Story Title
   * Enforce 100% grounding with source citations

## Description
  * As a clinician, I want every extracted entity to have valid source citations, so that I can verify accuracy and trust the AI output.

## Acceptance Criteria
  * Given an extracted entity, When validated, Then it must have valid source citations (FR-051).
  * Given entities without citations, When detected, Then they are rejected and not stored as final (FR-056, NFR-006).
  * Given citations, When stored, Then they include document_id, page, section, coordinates, and cited text (TR-008).
  * Given grounding enforcement, When applied, Then 100% of displayed entities have verifiable sources.

## Edge Cases
   * What happens when LLM generates entities without citations?
   * How does the system handle citations that point to non-existent locations?
   * What happens when the cited text doesn't match the entity value?
