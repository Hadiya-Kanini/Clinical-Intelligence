## Story Title
   * Monitor dead letter queue for failed jobs

## Description
  * As an operator, I want to monitor the dead letter queue for failed jobs, so that I can investigate and resolve processing issues.

## Acceptance Criteria
  * Given jobs exceed max retries, When moved to DLQ, Then they are available for inspection (FR-029).
  * Given the DLQ, When jobs are present, Then they include original message, error details, and retry history.
  * Given DLQ monitoring, When implemented, Then queue depth is exposed as a metric (NFR-011).
  * Given failed jobs, When in DLQ, Then operators can replay or discard them.

## Edge Cases
   * What happens when DLQ grows very large?
   * How does the system handle DLQ message expiration?
   * What happens when replaying a DLQ message fails again?
