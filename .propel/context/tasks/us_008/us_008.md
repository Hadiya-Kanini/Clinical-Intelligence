## Story Title
   * Show login loading indicator and prevent duplicate submits

## Description
  * As a user, I want a loading indicator during authentication, so that I know the login is in progress and don’t submit multiple times.

## Acceptance Criteria
  * Given I am on the Login page (SCR-001), When I click the Login button with valid-format inputs, Then a loading indicator is displayed during the authentication process.
  * Given authentication is in progress, When the loading indicator is shown, Then the UI blocks duplicate submissions (e.g., disables the submit button) until the request completes.
  * Given authentication completes successfully, When the response is received, Then the loading state clears and the user is redirected to the appropriate landing page.
  * Given authentication fails, When the response is received, Then the loading state clears and an actionable error message is shown.

## Edge Cases
   * What happens when authentication takes longer than expected (slow network) — is the UI still responsive and informative?
   * What happens when the user navigates away mid-request — does the UI avoid stale state or unexpected redirects?
   * What happens when the response returns quickly — does the UI avoid flicker while still providing feedback?
