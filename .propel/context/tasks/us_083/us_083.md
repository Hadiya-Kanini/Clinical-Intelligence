## Story Title
   * Map diagnoses to ICD-10 codes using fuzzy matching

## Description
  * As a medical coder, I want extracted diagnoses mapped to ICD-10 codes using fuzzy text matching, so that coding is efficient and accurate.

## Acceptance Criteria
  * Given extracted diagnoses, When mapping runs, Then matching ICD-10 codes are suggested (FR-065).
  * Given fuzzy matching, When performed, Then it handles variations in terminology.
  * Given code suggestions, When generated, Then they include confidence scores.
  * Given mapping results, When stored, Then they link to the source diagnosis entity.

## Edge Cases
   * What happens when no match is found (FR-069)?
   * How does the system handle ambiguous diagnoses with multiple possible codes?
   * What happens when the diagnosis text is very short or abbreviated?
