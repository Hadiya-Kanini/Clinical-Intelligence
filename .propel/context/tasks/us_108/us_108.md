## Story Title
   * Implement health check endpoints for API and Worker

## Description
  * As an operator, I want health check endpoints on Backend API and AI Worker, so that I can monitor system status and detect issues.

## Acceptance Criteria
  * Given the Backend API, When /health is called, Then system status is returned (FR-104).
  * Given the AI Worker, When /health, /health/ready, /health/live are called, Then appropriate status is returned (FR-105).
  * Given health checks, When dependencies are checked, Then database, queue, and external services are verified.
  * Given health endpoints, When implemented, Then they follow standard health check patterns (TR-012).

## Edge Cases
   * What happens when a dependency is unhealthy?
   * How does the system handle partial health (some services up, some down)?
   * What happens when health check itself times out?
