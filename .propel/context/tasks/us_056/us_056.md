## Story Title
   * Track processing metadata and surface errors

## Description
  * As a standard user, I want to see processing errors and timing information, so that I understand what happened with my documents.

## Acceptance Criteria
  * Given processing completes, When metadata is recorded, Then job ID, retry count, processing time, and timestamps are stored (FR-027).
  * Given processing fails, When error occurs, Then error message is captured and displayed to user (FR-028).
  * Given the document list, When a document has failed, Then the error message is visible.
  * Given processing metadata, When stored, Then it includes start time, completion time, and duration.

## Edge Cases
   * What happens when metadata storage fails after processing completes?
   * How does the system handle very long error messages?
   * What happens when processing times out?
