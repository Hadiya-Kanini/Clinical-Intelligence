## Story Title
   * Display code suggestions with Accept/Reject buttons

## Description
  * As a medical coder, I want to see code suggestions with descriptions, source references, and Accept/Reject buttons, so that I can review and approve codes efficiently.

## Acceptance Criteria
  * Given code suggestions, When displayed, Then each shows code, description, and source reference (FR-067, UXR-032).
  * Given each suggestion, When displayed, Then Accept and Reject buttons are available (FR-068).
  * Given Reject action, When clicked, Then the code is removed with one click (UXR-034).
  * Given code status, When tracked, Then it shows pending, accepted, rejected, or manually_added (FR-070).

## Edge Cases
   * What happens when there are many suggestions (10+)?
   * How does the system handle bulk accept/reject actions?
   * What happens when the user accidentally rejects a code?
