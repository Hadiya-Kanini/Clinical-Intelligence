## Story Title
   * Require explicit selection to resolve conflicts

## Description
  * As a clinician, I want to explicitly select the correct value to resolve conflicts, so that decisions are intentional and auditable.

## Acceptance Criteria
  * Given a conflict, When resolving, Then I must explicitly select a value (radio button or dropdown) (UXR-030).
  * Given the resolve button, When no selection is made, Then it remains disabled.
  * Given resolution, When a value is selected, Then the "Resolve" button becomes enabled.
  * Given resolution, When completed, Then the conflict is marked as resolved.

## Edge Cases
   * What happens when user wants to enter a different value (manual override)?
   * How does the system handle accidental selections?
   * What happens when the user changes their selection before confirming?
