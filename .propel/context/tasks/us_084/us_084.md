## Story Title
   * Map procedures to CPT codes using fuzzy matching

## Description
  * As a medical coder, I want extracted procedures mapped to CPT codes using fuzzy text matching, so that billing is complete and accurate.

## Acceptance Criteria
  * Given extracted procedures, When mapping runs, Then matching CPT codes are suggested (FR-066).
  * Given fuzzy matching, When performed, Then it handles variations in procedure names.
  * Given code suggestions, When generated, Then they include the source procedure reference.
  * Given mapping results, When stored, Then they are ready for review in the UI.

## Edge Cases
   * What happens when procedure description is ambiguous?
   * How does the system handle procedures with multiple applicable CPT codes?
   * What happens when the procedure text contains abbreviations?
