## Story Title
   * Show actionable login validation and auth errors

## Description
  * As a user, I want clear validation and authentication error messages on the Login page, so that I can quickly recover and access the platform.

## Acceptance Criteria
  * Given I am on the Login page (SCR-001), When I submit with an invalid email format, Then I see a field-level validation error indicating the email format is invalid.
  * Given I am on the Login page, When I submit with missing required fields (email or password), Then I see clear field-level validation errors and the form is not submitted.
  * Given I am on the Login page, When I submit valid-format inputs but credentials are incorrect, Then I see an actionable authentication error message.
  * Given the login attempt results in an auth-related restriction, When the system determines the account is locked, Then the UI shows a lockout message with guidance for next steps.
  * Given the login attempt fails, When the error message is displayed, Then it is presented in an accessible manner (e.g., alert region) and does not expose sensitive details.

## Edge Cases
   * What happens when multiple validation errors occur at once (e.g., empty email and empty password)?
   * What happens when the API is unreachable or times out—does the UI show a recoverable error without losing the entered email?
   * How does the UI avoid leaking whether an email exists vs not (only show generic messaging where required)?
