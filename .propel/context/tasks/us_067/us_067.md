## Story Title
   * Support extensible entity categories

## Description
  * As a platform engineer, I want the extraction system to support additional clinical categories beyond the core set, so that it can evolve with requirements.

## Acceptance Criteria
  * Given the extraction system, When designed, Then it supports adding new categories without major code changes (FR-049).
  * Given new categories, When added, Then they follow the same schema validation pattern.
  * Given the prompt template, When designed, Then it is configurable for additional categories.
  * Given extensibility, When implemented, Then existing categories are not affected by additions.

## Edge Cases
   * What happens when a new category conflicts with existing ones?
   * How does the system handle category deprecation?
   * What happens when category schemas change?
