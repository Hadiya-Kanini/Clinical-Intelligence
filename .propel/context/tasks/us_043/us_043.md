## Story Title
   * Display per-file upload progress with percentage

## Description
  * As a standard user, I want to see upload progress for each file with percentage indicator, so that I know how long the upload will take.

## Acceptance Criteria
  * Given files are uploading, When progress updates, Then each file shows a progress bar with percentage (UXR-020).
  * Given upload progress, When displayed, Then it updates in real-time (NFR-016).
  * Given multiple files, When uploading, Then each file has its own independent progress indicator.
  * Given upload in progress, When displayed, Then a cancel option is available for each file.

## Edge Cases
   * What happens when upload stalls or connection is slow?
   * How does the UI handle progress for very small files (instant upload)?
   * What happens when the browser tab is backgrounded during upload?
