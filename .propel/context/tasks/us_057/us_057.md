## Story Title
   * Provide real-time status updates during processing

## Description
  * As a standard user, I want real-time status updates as processing completes, so that I don't have to manually refresh the page.

## Acceptance Criteria
  * Given documents are processing, When status changes, Then the UI updates automatically (FR-026).
  * Given real-time updates, When implemented, Then they refresh at least every 5 seconds (UXR-043).
  * Given the document list, When a document completes, Then the status badge updates without page reload.
  * Given the UI, When real-time updates are active, Then a manual refresh button is also available.

## Edge Cases
   * What happens when WebSocket/polling connection is lost?
   * How does the system handle many concurrent status updates?
   * What happens when the user navigates away and returns?
